## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Open edX installation (Lilac or newer recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for Monaco Editor CDN fallback)
- Judge0 API access (RapidAPI or self-hosted)

### Step 1: Install the XBlock

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-coding-xblock.git
cd advanced-coding-xblock
pip install -e .

# Or install from PyPI (when published)
pip install advanced-coding-xblock
```

### Step 2: Enable in Open edX

Add the XBlock to your Open edX configuration:

```python
# In /edx/app/edxapp/cms.env.json and lms.env.json
XBLOCK_SETTINGS = {
    "AdvancedCodingXBlock": {
        "judges": {
            "judge0": {
                "api_url": "https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com",
                "api_key": "your-rapidapi-key",
                "api_host": "judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com"
            }
        }
    }
}

# Add to ADVANCED_COMPONENT_TYPES
ADVANCED_COMPONENT_TYPES = [
    {
        "component": "advanced_coding",
        "boilerplate_name": None,
        "tab": "advanced",
        "editor_saved_state": "never"
    }
]
```

### Step 3: Configure Judge0 API

1. Sign up for RapidAPI: https://rapidapi.com/
2. Subscribe to Judge0 CE: https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce/
3. Get your API key and configure it in the XBlock settings

### Step 4: Restart Open edX Services

```bash
sudo /edx/bin/supervisorctl restart edxapp:*
```

## Configuration

### Judge0 Setup

The XBlock requires Judge0 API for code execution. You can use either:

1. **RapidAPI (Recommended for development)**:
   - Easy setup with free tier
   - Managed service with high availability
   - Built-in rate limiting and monitoring

2. **Self-hosted Judge0**:
   - More control and customization
   - Better for production with high volume
   - Requires Docker and server management

### Language Configuration

Configure supported programming languages in Studio:

```json
{
  "python": {
    "id": 71,
    "name": "Python 3",
    "extension": "py",
    "template": "# Write your Python code here\nprint('Hello, World!')"
  },
  "java": {
    "id": 62,
    "name": "Java",
    "extension": "java",
    "template": "public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n    }\n}"
  }
}
```

### Test Cases Configuration

Set up automated test cases for grading:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "test_1",
    "name": "Basic Test",
    "input": "5 3",
    "expected_output": "8",
    "is_public": true,
    "points": 10,
    "timeout": 2.0
  }
]
```

## Security Considerations

### Code Execution Security

- All code execution happens in Judge0 sandboxed containers
- Strict resource limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Content filtering blocks dangerous patterns

### Data Protection

- Student code is stored securely in Open edX database
- API keys are encrypted in configuration
- No student data is sent to external services except for execution
- GDPR and FERPA compliant data handling

### Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for Judge0 API calls
2. **Rotate API Keys**: Regular rotation of Judge0 API keys
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track API usage and set appropriate limits
4. **Content Review**: Review and approve problem statements
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep XBlock and dependencies updated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Monaco Editor Not Loading**:
- Check browser console for CDN errors
- Verify internet connectivity for CDN access
- Try clearing browser cache

**Judge0 API Errors**:
- Verify API key and host configuration
- Check RapidAPI subscription status
- Review rate limiting and quotas

**Code Execution Timeouts**:
- Increase execution time limits
- Optimize test case complexity
- Check Judge0 service status

**File Save Failures**:
- Check file size limits
- Verify file name restrictions
- Review content validation rules
